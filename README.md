# IoT-XR-Proj

This project will be a comprehensive tutorial as myself  learn about  
Arduino, Raspbery Pi4, and Wifi-Chips.

## Current Devices  
+  [Arduino]   
+  [Raspberry Pi 4] **(Required)** | 4GB RAM _(2GB min)_ | [64GB] Storage _([16GB] --> [32GB] **recomended**)_  
   +  [CanaKit] with air cooling  
+  [NodeMCU] 1.0 ESP 12E Module

# Project 1
Create node server for handling requests


## Step 1 - Get Raspian Image
---
Download [Raspian Buster Lite]

---

## Step 2 _(optional)_ Unzip image
---
Unzip the image
- [7-Zip] | Windows
- [Unzip] | Linux\Mac
---
## Step 3 - Create Raspbian Bootable 
---
The simplest method I found, that had the same desired  
outcome as manual tools was [balenaEtcher]  

Simply navigate to the .zip or the .img Raspbian file and   
select the MicroSD you wish to create as a bootable

---
## Step 4 - Create SSH file
---
